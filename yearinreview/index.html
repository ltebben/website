        <h1>Year in Review</h1>
        <p>This year was probably the most successful year of my college career. I made huge strides in my technical knowledge
            and capabilities. I was put on meaningful programming projects during co-op. I took every opportunity to learn
            and challenge myself technically and personally. I attended hackathons to teach myself teamwork and new technologies.
            I took on the position of Logistics Director for the UC hackathon to practice my leadership and management skills.
            I made this website to teach myself web development. My hard work has really paid off and I feel much more secure
            in my technical and leadership capabilites now than I did a year ago. The University is starting to notice too:
            this year I received the Mantei/Mae Award, a scholarship given to the top ~15 students in the EECS department.
        </p>

        <p>I have found my accomplishments to be very helpful in the co-op job search, and I intend to continue pushing myself
            to become an even stronger programmer and an even better communicator in preparation for the full-time job search.
            I have learned a lot about what types of programming I enjoy doing, and what I am not so fond of. I have also
            gotten a glimpse at just how much I have left to learn, and I plan to continue using personal projects and hackathons
            to get experience in these areas if classes are not an option.
        </p>

        <p>This upcoming year, I will continue my work with ACM and RevolutionUC. I plan to lead the Logistics team again, and
            we hope to continue increasing the size of the event every year. I will start co-op with a new company and hope
            to prove myself as a strong developer and a good addition to their team. One thing I would like to learn this
            year is full-stack web development. I am comfortable now using HTML and CSS to build a static responsive website,
            but I don't know anything about connecting a site to a database, using Express for routing, or really anything
            more than the basics. My personal projects this year are going to revolve around becoming a more capable web
            developer.
        </p>
        
        <p>Overall I had a great year and I am looking forward to my upcoming semesters. I am taking a lot of interesting techincal
            courses and am really looking forward to my next co-op job. I think I will enjoy my classes and co-ops more and
            more as I become stronger technically and get increasingly challenging work.
        </p>
